<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About me</h3>
I am currently a Ph.D. student at The University of Chicago, <a href = "http://galton.uchicago.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> working 
under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://galton.uchicago.edu/~jianding/">Jian Ding</a>. I obtained my Bachelors and Masters 
degree in Statistics from the <a href="http://www.isical.ac.in/">Indian Statistical Institute</a>, Kolkata in the years 2009 and 
2011 respectively. Prior to joining The University of Chicago as a graduate student I worked for a year as an analytics specialist 
in <a href="https://www.operasolutions.com/">Opera Solutions and Management Consultancy Pvt. Ltd</a>.

I then did a one year post doc before joining my current position as a 
Kruskal instructor here at University of Chicago.
