<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About me</h3>
I am currently a graduate student at University of Chicago, Department of Statistics and working in Matthew Stephens lab. 
My primary research area is Statistical genomics, in particular, analyzing RNA-seq data and trying to investigate the 
cell-type or tissue-type effects from multiple sample single cell/ bulk RNA sequencing. Besides this, I am also working 
on Ancient DNA data analysis, phylogenetics and metagenomics data.
